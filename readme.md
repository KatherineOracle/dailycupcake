--- PROJECT OBJECTIVES ---

○ Create a functional “Save for later” page for your website, where users can earmark articles, images, recipes, etc. in a personal folder to be
able to go back and see them later.

    ■  This is achieved with both  the 'cupcake alert' and cart features 

○ Each item/recipe/image, etc. must have the option to “Save for later”.

    ■  This is achieved with the 'cupcake alert' buttons

○ When an item is added, an alert should tell the user how many items
are in their “Save for later” folder.

    ■  This is achieved with on the 'cupcake alert' buttons

○ Create a new HTML page for the “Save for later” section, which allows
the user to see what is in their folder.

    ■  See "alerts" page 

○ Create a form which allows a user to leave comments.

    ■  Click review on any cupcake - the comment is only saved locally for now

○ Create forms to allow a user to “like” an item/article/etc.

    ■  See rating functionality which is part of the review form. 

○ Create forms for if a person would like to contact you.

    ■  See contact us page - the form does not yet submit to a server, just gives a fake response. 

○ Within the entirety of your site, you should have at least the following
jQuery functionality:
■ A function which contains hiding/showing.
    - See menu in mobile mode
    - See Offcanvas review panel
■ A drop-down menu.
  - See primary menu in mobile mode where menu must 'drop down'
■ Animation effects.
 - Capcake alerts notifications fade out 
 - Removing cupcakes from the alert list fades them out before removing
■ A function with chained effects.
 - As per above
 - Contact form show/hide response also uses chained effects.  


---- FOR A LAUGH ----
So my harddrive crashed two weeks ago and I lost my 'shop.js' file and had to redo it all. 
Definitely time to get into using github to avoid further disasters like that!
