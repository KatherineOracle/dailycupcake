HyperionDev Capstone Project IV: JavaScript Fundamentals
---
This was the last Capstone Project for level 1 of the fullstack developer bootcamp.

## Project requirements
Expand on your previous Capstone project (HTML and SCSS). Within the entirety of the site, have the following JavaScript
functionality:
* Create a functional “Save for later” page for your website, where users can earmark articles, images, recipes, etc. in a personal folder to be able to go back and see them later.
* Each item/recipe/image, etc. must have the option to “Save for later”.
* When an item is added, an alert should tell the user how many items are in their “Save for later” folder.
* Create a new HTML page for the “Save for later” section, which allows the user to see what is in their folder.
* Create a form which allows a user to leave comments.
* Create forms to allow a user to “like” an item/article/etc.
* Create forms for if a person would like to contact you.
* Within the entirety of your site, you should have at least the following jQuery functionality:
    * A function which contains hiding/showing.
    * A drop-down menu.
    * Animation effects.
    * A function with chained effects.

## Installation
